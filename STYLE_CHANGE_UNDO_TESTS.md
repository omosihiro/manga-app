# Style Change Undo Tests

## Overview
Created comprehensive tests to verify that speech style changes are properly tracked and can be undone/redone.

## Test Location
`/app/src/__tests__/StyleChangeSimple.test.jsx`

## Test Coverage

### 1. **Style Changes Update State**
- Verifies that changing speech styles (shape, size, color) triggers the `onPagesUpdate` callback
- Confirms the updated pages contain the new style values
- Ensures other style properties remain unchanged

### 2. **Multiple Style Changes**
- Tests that each style change creates a separate update call
- Verifies that the undo system can track individual changes
- Each change is isolated and can be undone independently

### 3. **Segmented Button (Tail Direction)**
- Tests the tail direction toggle (Left/Right)
- Verifies the segmented button UI updates correctly
- Confirms the style object is updated with the new tail value

### 4. **Radio Chips (Animation)**
- Tests animation selection through radio chips
- Verifies that clicking different animation options updates the style
- Confirms the correct animation value is saved

### 5. **Simulated Undo Behavior**
- Demonstrates how the undo system works with style changes
- Shows that reverting to a previous state restores all style values
- Simulates the behavior of the actual undo/redo system

## Key Findings

1. **Each style change creates a new state** - Every modification to speech styles (shape, size, color, tail, animation) calls `onPagesUpdate` with the complete updated pages array.

2. **State is immutable** - The Pages Panel creates a new pages array for each change, preserving the ability to undo.

3. **Undo/Redo works automatically** - Since the App component wraps pages with `useUndo`, all style changes are automatically tracked in the undo history.

## How Undo Works

1. User changes a style property in PagesPanel
2. PagesPanel calls `onPagesUpdate` with new pages array
3. App.js receives the update through `setPages` (from useUndo)
4. useUndo automatically adds this state to the undo history
5. When user presses Cmd+Z, useUndo reverts to previous state
6. PagesPanel re-renders with the previous pages data
7. All style values are restored to their previous state

## Test Results
âœ… All 5 tests passing
- Style changes properly update state
- Multiple changes create separate undo states
- UI controls (buttons, selects, radio) work correctly
- Undo simulation demonstrates state rollback
