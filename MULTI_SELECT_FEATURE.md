- Clears any previous selection

### 2. **Cmd/Ctrl + Click**
- Toggles selection of individual pages
- Add or remove pages from current selection

### 3. **Shift + Click**
- Selects a range of pages
- From the last selected page to the clicked page

### 4. **Cmd/Ctrl + A**
- Selects all pages in the panel

### 5. **Escape**
- Deselects all pages

## Bulk Operations Toolbar

When pages are selected, a toolbar appears with the following operations:

### **â†‘ Move Up**
- Moves all selected pages up by one position
- Maintains relative order of selected pages
- Disabled if the first page is selected

### **â†“ Move Down**
- Moves all selected pages down by one position
- Maintains relative order of selected pages
- Disabled if the last page is selected

### **âŽ˜ Duplicate**
- Creates copies of all selected pages
- Copies are added at the end with " (copy)" suffix

### **ðŸ—‘ Delete**

## Visual Feedback

- Selected pages have a blue border and darker background

## Drag & Drop with Multi-Select

- Dragging any selected page will move all selected pages together
- Useful for moving multiple pages between groups (Start/Normal/Big)
